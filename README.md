       Fear of Falling (FoF) is commonly linked to postural and gait abnormalities, leading to reduced mobility in individuals with Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Variability in knee flexion during heel-strike and toe-off events while walking can indicate an individual’s FoF level. As PD progresses, gait abnormalities such as hesitation during start, turn, and stop phases become more pronounced, affecting cadence and weight transfer between legs. Task demands and pathway conditions further influence gait and posture, necessitating a deeper investigation into their impact. To address this, a portable, wearable, and cost-effective device, SmartWalk, has been developed. SmartWalk integrates instrumented shoes with knee flexion recorder units to monitor gait-related indices and knee flexion in real-life conditions.
                                         Our study evaluated SmartWalk in age-matched groups of healthy individuals (GrpH) and individuals with PD (GrpPD). Results demonstrated SmartWalk’s ability to assess the impact of task conditions, pathways (with and without turns), and pathway segments (straight and turn) on knee flexion and gait. Findings indicated a strong correlation between knee flexion, gait-related indices, and clinical measures of FoF, particularly in GrpPD. This suggests that SmartWalk can serve as a valuable tool for preclinical assessment, offering clinicians critical insights into gait abnormalities and FoF-related risks in individuals with PD.
